# Steam Decky Windows Inter-Process Bridge & Game Launcher
**Project Identity:** `steams-windows-plug-in-`
**Harness Specification:** Antigravity Autonomous Lead Engineer Protocol & EGE-2
**Configuration Type:** Project-Specific User-Defined Rules (`GEMINI.md`)

---

## 1. Project Invariants & Domain Rules
* **Process Isolation:** Win32/C++ inter-process bridge calls must handle timeouts and unexpected termination gracefully.
* **Non-Blocking I/O:** Socket communication with Decky loader must be asynchronous.
* **Zero Elevated Privilege Escalation:** Run with lowest viable process permissions.

## 2. Injected Rule Modules (`.agent/rules/*.md`)
This project automatically injects 7 modular rule files from `.agent/rules/` into agent memory context (`<MEMORY[*.md]>`):
1. `01-autonomous-developer.md`: Recursive Thinking, State Sync, Context-Aware Coding & Zero Chat Drift
2. `02-quantum-epistemics.md`: EGE-2 7-Tier Evidence Standard & Anti-Sycophancy
3. `03-mind-virus-defense.md`: Anti-Propagation & Self-Replication Defense Directive
4. `04-shift-left-security.md`: IBM 5 Shift-Left Security & Safe Shell Guard
5. `05-delegation-diligence.md`: Claude Academy 4D Delegation-Diligence Loop
6. `06-runtime-validation.md`: Rigorous Runtime Validation (Unit, Prometheus, Mocks)
7. `07-istl-supervisor.md`: ISTL Graded Confidence & CEO Supervisor Interventions

## 3. Slash Command Workflows (`<workflows>`)
See detailed index at [.agent/workflows/INDEX.md](file:///Users/malcolm/steams-windows-plug-in-/.agent/workflows/INDEX.md):
- `/goal <task>`: Autonomous end-to-end task completion loop.
- `/schedule <cron_or_seconds>`: Schedule recurring cron or one-shot timers.
- `/plan <task>`: Step-by-step implementation plan generation.
- `/grill-me <topic>`: Interactive user interview for design trade-offs.
- `/learn <lesson>`: Save lessons learned to persistent memory.
- `/fable-method <task>`: Execute full evidence-based 7-step engineering loop.

---

## 4. Skills Catalog & Context-Aware Coding (`<skills>`)
See comprehensive index at [.agent/skills/INDEX.md](file:///Users/malcolm/steams-windows-plug-in-/.agent/skills/INDEX.md):
- Access to 217+ system and plugin skills across Harness, Security, Quant, Database, Science, and Web.
- **IBM Context-Aware Coding (`context-aware-coder`)**: Pre-computed compact AST repo map, exact lockfile dependency versions, and test feedback loop stored at `.agents/context_map.json`. Supports `repo-map`, `deps`, `tests`, `interview`, `bundle` (U-Shaped Attention hygiene), and `learn` (persists conventions to `GEMINI.md`).
- **Vanta Security & Scaling Guardrails (`vanta-guardrails`)**: `cost-calc`, `schema-validate`, `sanitize-prompt`, `cache-budget`, `audit-privacy`.

## 5. Verification & Runtime Testing
Execute the following verification command to confirm build health and invariant preservation:
```bash
bash install-macos.sh --dry-run || pytest tests/ -v
```
